# Machine reference table

Phase 0 of `machines-plan.md`. This is the data the shipped machine definitions are generated
from in phase 2, and the yardstick phase 1 audits today's profiles against.

Sources, in order of weight: the values that shipped after the raster-geometry work
(`config/config.conf` layouts, validated against Spectaculator and Fuse), the shipped profiles,
the cores themselves, and published hardware documentation. Anything that rests on nothing
better than convention is marked **open** and left alone.

Goes away with `machines-plan.md` when the rework is done.

## 1. Timing and video

`layout` names an entry of the `[VIDEO]` layout table in `config.conf`. Its fields, in file
order, are `full.x:full.y:bord.x:bord.y:blank.x:blank.y:intSize:intpos.y:intpos.x:scr.x:scr.y`,
all in dots; two dots make one CPU tick, so T per line is `full.x / 2` and the INT pulse is
`intSize / 2` ticks.

| machine | CPU, Hz | layout | T/line | lines | T/frame | INT, T | contPattern | contio | contmem | 4t-border | earlyTiming |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZX Spectrum 48K | 3 500 000 | ZX 48K | 224 | 312 | 69 888 | 32 | 1 (Ferranti) | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| ZX Spectrum 128K / +2 | 3 546 900 | ZX 128K | 228 | 311 | 70 908 | 36 | 1 (Ferranti) | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| ZX Spectrum +2A | 3 546 900 | ZX +2A/+3 | 228 | 311 | 70 908 | 32 **open** | 2 (Amstrad) | no | yes | yes | yes |
| ZX Spectrum +3 | 3 546 900 | ZX +2A/+3 | 228 | 311 | 70 908 | 32 **open** | 2 (Amstrad) | no | yes | yes | yes |
| Pentagon | 3 500 000 | Pentagon | 224 | 320 | 71 680 | 36 | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| Pentagon 1024 SL | 3 500 000 | Pentagon | 224 | 320 | 71 680 | 36 | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| ZS Scorpion 256 | 3 500 000 | Scorpion | 224 | 312 | 69 888 | 36 | 0 (none) | no | no | yes | no |
| Profi | 3 500 000 | Profi | 224 | 312 | 69 888 | 32 **open** | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| ATM Turbo 2+ | 3 500 000 | ATM Turbo 2+ | 224 | 312 | 69 888 | 32 **open** | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| ZXM-Phoenix | 3 500 000 | Pentagon | 224 | 320 | 71 680 | 36 | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| ZX Evolution (BaseConf) | 3 500 000 | Pentagon | 224 | 320 | 71 680 | 36 | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |
| ZX Evolution (TSConf) | 3 500 000 | TSConf | 224 | 320 | 71 680 | 32 **open** | 0 (none) | no | no | no | no |

Contention patterns are `vid_wait_dots()` in `video/video.c`: 1 is the Ferranti ULA's
`12,11,...,1,0,0,0,0` over banks 1/3/5/7, 2 the Amstrad ASIC's `2,1,0,0,14,...,3` over banks
4-7 and mreq cycles only, 0 is no contention at all.

The **open** INT lengths are the ones nobody has confirmed a figure for. Three of them
(Profi, ATM, TSConf) were deliberately left at 32 T in the raster work. The fourth is a real
inconsistency: the +2A/+3 was named in that round's decision - 36 T for the 311-line machines
plus Pentagon and Scorpion - but its layout line still says 32 T while the 128K, Pentagon and
Scorpion lines carry 36. Nothing on screen changes either way; only a program sampling the INT
line late in a long instruction can tell.

Also still open from that work: Profi's `intpos` puts the first paper dot 32 T after the
interrupt where UnrealSpeccy's preset says 12 580, and ATM Turbo 2+ is 11 T out. Neither has an
official figure behind it.

**None of these is being changed by this rework** (decided 2026-09-09): the timings stay as
they ship. They are listed so a definition generated from this table carries today's value on
purpose rather than by accident.

## 2. Memory, storage and sound

RAM is what the core's `mask` field allows; the bold size is what the shipped profile picks.

| machine | RAM | disk | HDD | sound | mouse |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZX Spectrum 48K | 16K, **64K** | none | none | beeper | no |
| ZX Spectrum 48K + TR-DOS | 16K, **64K** | Beta Disk | none | beeper + 1 AY (Melodik) | yes |
| ZX Spectrum 128K / +2 | **128K** | none | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZX Spectrum 128K + TR-DOS | **128K** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY + Covox | yes |
| ZX Spectrum +2A | **128K** | none | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZX Spectrum +3 | **128K** | uPD765 | none | 1 AY | no |
| Pentagon | **128K**, 512K | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| Pentagon 1024 SL | **1M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZS Scorpion 256 | **256K**, 1M | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| Profi | 512K, **1M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| ATM Turbo 2+ | 128K, 256K, 512K, **1M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZXM-Phoenix | **2M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZX Evolution (BaseConf) | **4M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |
| ZX Evolution (TSConf) | **4M** | Beta Disk | none | 1 AY | no |

The two `+ TR-DOS` entries are **extended machines on purpose** - an interface and a sound
card fitted, the way these were used. The shipped profile is the authority on what a machine
carries (decided 2026-09-09); the 48K's AY is a Melodik or a Fuller Box and stays. The one
correction: the 128K had a three-chip TurboSound, and is back to the one AY it comes with.

Which TR-DOS version the 48K machines ran is unsettled, and does not matter yet.

## 3. Port decode

Only the fields that separate one machine from another; the rest is common ZX.

| machine | 0x7FFD mask | bank field | extra paging |
|---|---|---|---|
| ZX Spectrum 128K / +2 | 0xC002 | bits 0-2 | - |
| ZX Spectrum +2A / +3 | 0xC002 | bits 0-2 | 0x1FFD (mask 0xF002): special modes, ROM bit 2 |
| Pentagon | 0x8002 | bits 0-2 + 6-7 | - |

The 0x8002 mask is what makes a Pentagon a Pentagon here: a write to 0x3FFD pages as well,
where a Sinclair machine ignores it. Bits 6-7 are the 512K extension the 128K does not have.
Both differences are why the 128K needed its own core (phase 1) instead of borrowing
Pentagon's.

## 4. ROM banks

The bank index is `roffset / 16K` in today's romset table and becomes the `rom<N>` key in the
machine definition (plan, 6.2). ROM paging is `(flgDOS ? 2 : 0) | flgROM` on every 128K-style machine,
so bank 0 is the 128 editor, 1 the 48 BASIC, and 2/3 the interface ROM.

| machine | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ZX Spectrum 48K | 48.rom | - | - | - |
| ZX Spectrum 48K + TR-DOS | 48.rom | trdos.rom | - | - |
| ZX Spectrum 128K | 128-0.rom | 128-1.rom | - | - |
| ZX Spectrum 128K + TR-DOS | 128-0.rom | 128-1.rom | - | trdos.rom |
| ZX Spectrum +2 (ROM set of the 128K) | plus2-0.rom | plus2-1.rom | - | - |
| ZX Spectrum +2A / +3 (v4.0) | plus3-0.rom | plus3-1.rom | plus3-2.rom | plus3-3.rom |
| ZX Spectrum +3 (v4.1) | plus3-41.rom, 64K combined | | | |
| Pentagon 128 | 128p-0.rom | 128p-1.rom | gluck.rom | trdos504t.rom |
| Pentagon 128 (TR-DOS 5.03) | 128p-0.rom | 128p-1.rom | gluck.rom | trdos.rom |
| ZS Scorpion 256 | 256s-0.rom | 256s-1.rom | 256s-2.rom | 256s-3.rom |
| ZS Scorpion 256 (ProfROM 3.9f) | prof39f.rom, 128K combined | | | |
| Profi | profi.rom, 64K combined | | | |
| ATM Turbo 2+ | atm2.rom, 64K combined | | | |
| ZXM-Phoenix | phoenix.rom, 64K combined | | | |
| ZX Evolution (BaseConf) | zxevo-fe.rom, 512K combined | | | |
| ZX Evolution (TSConf) | tsconf.rom, 64K combined | | | |

Every ZX machine except the Sinclair ones also names `gs = gs105b.rom` (General Sound), and
ATM, Profi and both Evo sets name `font = sgen.rom`.

## 5. Names

The display names and machine ids are section 7.3 of the plan; nothing in this file competes
with it. The core names phase 1 settles on are `ZX48`, `ZX128`, `Plus2A`, `Plus3`, `Pentagon`,
`Pentagon1024SL`, `Scorpion`, `Profi`, `ATM2`, `Phoenix`, `Baseconf`, `Baseconf21`, `TSConf`.
