# Provenance of the bundled ROM images

Every file in `config/roms/` is listed here. Nothing else is bundled, and no image
was modified - the copyright messages inside them are intact. See `LICENSE` in this
directory for the distribution terms, and `AMSTRAD.copyright` for the canonical
Sinclair/Amstrad notice (copied verbatim from the Fuse emulator; it also mentions a
few images that are not bundled here).

File names follow Fuse where Fuse carries the same image, so a set can be compared
file by file with `fuse-extra-roms`. Images that Fuse does not carry keep a plain
name of their own.

MD5 is given so a rebuild of the bundle can be checked against this table.

## Tier 1 - explicit permission

Copyright Amstrad, who allow distribution of the ROMs but retain the copyright.

## Tier 3 - clone firmware, derivative or unclear terms

Firmware of Soviet / post-Soviet ZX clones. The 128 BASIC part inside them descends
from the Amstrad code, the rest was written by the clone authors. No formal license
was ever published for any of these; they have been distributed with the machines
and with every emulator of them for decades.
