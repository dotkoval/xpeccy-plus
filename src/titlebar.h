// Windows 11 only (via DWM); a no-op elsewhere - Linux window managers and
// macOS don't expose a portable way to recolour a titlebar they draw
// themselves. Safe to call on any widget at any time: no-op if the widget
// isn't a top-level window, and the DWM call itself is ignored by Windows
// versions that don't support it.
