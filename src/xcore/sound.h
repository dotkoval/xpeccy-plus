// The ring is sbuf in sound.cpp, 4 bytes to a frame - 341 ms at 48kHz. It is

// the highest rate the app offers. the ring holds fewer ms the higher this
// goes, so it is what the size has to be checked against (see pacing.cpp)
#define SND_MAX_RATE		48000

// Output rates offered, highest first, 0 terminates. It lives here rather than
// in the options dialog because the config parser has to check against the same
// list - a rate this build does not offer would leave the box with nothing
// selected. 11025 and 22050 were dropped in 2026.4: every audio engine now runs
// at 44100 or 48000, so a lower rate only bought a resample on the way out plus
// the fold-back our box decimation cannot filter.
//
// Auto is bounded by the same list, so a device running at anything else - 96000,
// say - is still asked for the nearest of these and still resamples. Following it
// exactly would mean sizing the ring at run time, which SND_MAX_RATE rules out.
